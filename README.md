## Setting up your environment.

If you're using `pyenv`, make sure you're using the right version of python (either set globally or locally for this directory). 


# this will create a virtual environment in the env/ folder in your repo
$ python -m venv env

# then to activate your virtualenv
$ source env/bin/activate

# you'll see your env is activated
# because there'll be '(env)' written in your terminal prompt
(env) $ 

# to deactivate your env use:
(env) $ deactivate

# you'll see the '(env)' is gone
$ 
```
